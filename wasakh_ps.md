## sudo code

### phase 1: move to b

#### cases 
while(stack_a){
if top in range : pb and if top->next > top sb;
if top <= range : pb and rb;
else(top<range) : ra;
range++ after each move and when end = size-1 icrease only the start;
 }

### phase 2: ; push it back to a sorted 

while(stack_b){
- half_size = get half the size of the stack ;
- biggest_node_index = serch for biggest in in stack_b and get its index ;
- biggest_node_index < half_size ? yes = rotate untile you get it : no = rrb til you get it; 
}
